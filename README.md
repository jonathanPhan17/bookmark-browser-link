The objective of this project is to store useful links with a todo items that can be prioritized using the labels HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.  

An item contains: 

- a link  
- a short text description 
- date of creation  
- priority label (`HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`) 

The Bookmark Browser Link enables you to eliminate tabs in your browser. Therefore, we reduce memory consumption of your computer, because using the browser as a todo list is counterproductive.
